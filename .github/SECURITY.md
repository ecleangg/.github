# ‚öñÔ∏è Security Policy

To ensure the safety of our customers during any potential vulnerabilities in one of our products or services, we kindly request that you review this security policy to learn how to report any security flaws you discover to us.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This security policy applies to all products and services offered by [eclean.gg](https://eclean.gg) that may contain security vulnerabilities.

## üì° Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please contact ``hello(at)eclean.gg`` directly to report any security issues with our products or services.**

We make every effort to respond as quickly as possible, but it may take up to two days to synchronize internally and determine the severity and impact of the report. <u>Please do not report sensitive security issues via public channels or GitHub issues.</u>

As part of the process, we will generate a security advisory for the affected versions and make it public, typically two to four weeks after the release of a version that addresses the vulnerability.
